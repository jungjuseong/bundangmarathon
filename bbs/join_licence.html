		  <p>The majority of the U.S. team at the first modern Olympics, held 
			 in 1896 in Athens, Greece, was comprised of B.A.A. members. They 
			 won a total of seven medals at the Games and were inspired by 
			 the marathon at that first Olympics such that they established 
			 a marathon to conclude the B.A.A. Track &amp; Field Games in 1897. 
			 Thus the B.A.A. Marathon was born.</p>
		  <p>Today's B.A.A. Running Club is comprised of a dedicated corps of 
			 athletes with diverse running backgrounds and competitive goals. 
			 Club members participate in weekly workouts and meet regularly 
			 for organized long runs on selected weekends in preparation for 
			 spring and fall marathons.</p>
		  <p>As a team, the B.A.A. is a perennial contender at major New England 
			 road races, indoor and outdoor track meets, and cross country 
			 events. Individually, the club boasts a number of regional champions 
			 who have participated in national and international competitions.</p>
		  <p>Since 1991, the B.A.A. Running Club has enjoyed extensive and generous 
			 support from adidas.</p>
		  <p><a name="Benefits"></a><span class="MarathonTextTitle">BENEFITS</span></p>
		  <p><b>Coaching</b> <br>
			 B.A.A. coaches assist our members to fully develop their athletic 
			 potential. One of the greatest benefits to members is access to 
			 our strong coaching staff, which is committed to providing training 
			 structure and guidance designed to meet your individual running 
			 and racing goals. </p>
		  <p><b>Workout Groups</b><br>
			 As a member of the B.A.A. Running Club, you will be part of a 
			 network of runners and track athletes who have similar personal 
			 and competitive goals. Running and training with individuals of 
			 similar ability and fitness levels will help improve your performance. 
			 Year-round coached workouts take place in the Metro-Boston area.</p>
		  <p><b>adidas</b><br>
			 adidas affords the B.A.A. the ability to offer services to our 
			 membership for yearly dues of $35. B.A.A. Running Club members 
			 who regularly compete in races will receive an adidas uniform 
			 consisting of shorts and singlet. B.A.A. Running Club members 
			 also receive discounts on adidas apparel and shoes at Boston area 
			 running stores.</p>
		  <p><a name="Objectives"></a><span class="MarathonTextTitle">OBJECTIVES</span></p>
		  <p><b>Road Racing</b><br>
			 The B.A.A. has a strong presence at selected major New England 
			 road racing events. The club fosters excellence and participation 
			 in the USA Track &amp; Field New England Grand Prix Series (5K 
			 through the marathon).<br>
			 Additionally, the B.A.A. fields competitive teams at most regionally-based 
			 national road championships, such as the Freihofer's 5K, the Tufts 
			 HealthPlan 10K for Women and the New Haven 20K.</p>
		  <p><b>Track &amp; Field</b><br>
			 The B.A.A. places individuals at nearly every regional meet, including 
			 the (indoors) Terrier Invitational, G.B.T.C. Invitational, adidas 
			 Boston Indoor Games, St. Valentine's Invitational and the (outdoors) 
			 Penn Relays, Mt. Sac Relays and the Boston High Performance Series.</p>
		  <p><b>Cross Country</b><br>
			 In the fall, harriers focus on a series of races at Franklin Park, 
			 with the Mayor's Cup and New England Championships as the primary 
			 goals. Among preparatory events is the Boston Cross Country series. 
			 The B.A.A. often elects to field full squads or individuals at 
			 the Fall and Winter USA Cross Country Championships. </p>
		  <p><b>Marathon</b><br>
			 As one of the most prestigious athletic events in the world, our 
			 Boston Marathon is naturally a major competitive objective for 
			 many B.A.A. Team members. Runners follow specific training and 
			 racing programs tailored to their individual abilities, ambitions 
			 and target races. Team competition at the Boston Marathon promotes 
			 a spirited and friendly rivalry among local and national clubs.</p>
